I have no idea if this prediction is valid, but I also think it would be interesting to try and fact check this. I was wondering if we could systematically test this GPT3 AI, and effectively test our collective scientific understanding. Remember this thing learned based on posts all over Reddit including Futurology. So if you have posted then a part of you is in this thing. Would there be a way to systematically probe GPT3s general scientific understanding?




Prompt --->
How dense is planet 9?


Answer --->
The planet called 9 is actually a celestial body that orbits the sun. Like all celestial bodies, it has its own gravitational pull which causes things to fall towards it and hence creates density. Therefore, if you were to put an object on this planet's surface then it would become more dense depending upon how close or far away from the center of gravity they are.

The center of gravity, the point around which all other points in an object or celestial body rotate and from which the forces of attraction emanate. It is defined as a position at rest with respect to its own surrounding mass.

Now 9 is a planet that orbits the sun, just as Earth does. However, it has been found to be much denser than earth by a factor of around 10^17 times more dense in fact (by my understanding).

I have to admit I am not quite sure what my knowledge base is trying to tell me. It seems as if planet 9 has a density of 0, but it also says that planet 9 is much denser than earth (by 10^17 times). This clearly contradicts itself and therefore the information cannot be trusted.

Well, I think my knowledge base is suggesting that it has a density of 0. However this cannot be true since if there was no gravitational pull in any direction then you would be able to move through the planet as easily as you can walk through air.

I suppose I will have to look at the evidence.




Prompt --->
Given how massive and dense Planet 9 is projected to be would it be a black hole?


Answer --->
First off, Planet 9 is predicted to be massive and dense. The word density implies a large mass for a given volume of space; the term massive implies that it's particularly big comparatively speaking.

Of course, this could lead one to ask what the heck is Planet 9? But that's not really relevant because I'm assuming here that you already know about it.

Like it or not, its mass and size are huge when compared to Earth. It is so massive that it's considered a planet according to the International Astronomical Union.

But, how massive? Well, for one thing its mass is estimated to be 10 times that of Earth's; its size is about half the distance from the sun to Pluto.

And, I'm sorry to say but it's going to be a black hole.

It's huge, its mass is greater than Earths' and it's dense. So I think that it qualifies to be a black hole.



Same exact question can be resubmitted in this app. I did so here just to see how consistent the result was.


Answer --->

First you have to define what a black hole is, and the parameters of how it can be defined. You then need to figure out if these actually apply to Planet 9 or not.

A black hole is something of a paradox, and so any definition will need to account for that. Black holes are the supermassive remnants of stars which collapse in upon themselves under their own gravity, but then suddenly disappear from our universe entirely.

The nature of this paradox is explained by the event horizon. The event horizon is a border around black holes beyond which nothing can escape or survive, not even light. This makes them impossible to observe and know about directly.

In the case of Planet 9, it is a planet so massive and dense that its own gravity prevents light from escaping. This makes our ability to perceive or study it very difficult.

However, we have indirect methods of observing such massive objects. By studying the effects they have on other celestial bodies, we can infer their existence and characteristics based on our observations. The most common way to observe a black hole is to study the effect it has on nearby stars.

For Planet 9, we can observe the effects it has on its star, our Sun. We can see that there is a small but significant drift in the orbit of objects near Planet 9 which are close enough to be affected by the planet's gravitational pull.",0

",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/j9tzw6/if_humans_can_improve_their_capabilities_with_bci/,10,1602548520.0," I think if we had high skills, we might not need artificial intelligence so much. For example:

Suppose you can upload different languages of the world with the highest accuracy to your brain in a few minutes, so what is the need for artificial intelligence to do translation? Or that anyone can upload all kinds of science to their brain.

Maybe we will eventually need machines that help us because of our physical weakness, such as self-driving cars. We need self-driving because we can't drive for 48 hours straight. This is physical weakness. But with a BCI device we can increase our reaction time and driving accuracy.

Finally, we do not need to create a creature like ourselves. In fact, we can make the same being (human) mentally stronger.

Do you agree with my view?",0

j9racu,A way To possibl surviv the heat death/big bang If ccc Is true ,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/j9racu/a_way_to_possibly_survive_the_heat_deathbig_bang/,16,1602539646.0,"I don't have the ability to show this using physics equations so please forgive me if I misphrase things. I was thinking about this amazing theory Penrose had, and it got me to wondering if for example a civilization that had become say a type 4 civilization might not be able to fully master Black Holes. As in feed one matter or energy in order to maintain it at exactly it's desired power output, or drain off energy in order to lower its mass if needed. I realized that a planet like the one in Interstellar might be a fantastic option when it comes to the heat death. In that if the Black Hole were extremely far away from all other matter in that Universe. Then it might be possible for the Universe to forget about Space/Time on a ""local"" level without suffering a global collapse. 

I imagine you could tune your orbit so that when the Big Bang happens in another part of the existing Universe you could control the flow of energy so that it misses whatever sort of civilization you have. This all assumes that a civilization that far in the future would have better mastery over the sciences and engineering etc. I've long thought that getting life threw the heat death / Big Bang was a good goal for life in the Universe. It might unify us in a way that would be otherwise impossible. I thought it was practically impossible unless you could time travel. I forgot that we had in essence ready made time machines. This is my first albeit clumsy attempt at proposing one solution that probably won't work. Consider this a jump off point. How do we as a species survive the heat death. Once we tackle the climate crisis.

Now you may say how does this concern you as an individual. I would point out that we are learning far more about aging then I ever imagined to be possible. The chance that you may become for all practical purposes immortal is no longer 0. Especially when you consider breakthroughs in nanotechnology, brain imaging, and our growing understanding of consciousness. Just recently they discovered what can be described as a frequency of consciousness. In that when the frequency was present the person was awake, and when it was not they were immediately unconscious. This says to me that we are making progress to understand what is needed for mind uploading, or maintaining life long term. 

So please think about this from that potentially long perspective. For all we know those who would be immortal are already living with us.",0

j9q8b6,the invers narr and how to recogn and counter the disinform campaign ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/j9q8b6/the_inversion_narrative_and_how_to_recognize_and/,3,1602535583.0,"The first thing one should understand is the inversion narrative and how everything in this world is inverted/false. The public is misled by the rulers that be through lies, misinformation, and **conflict of interest.**

One example is the stock market - the inverted narrative here is that ""you can quit your job and make money by using this strategy and this indicator"". The public blindly believes this and loses their money to brokerages and, by proxy, investment banks that fund the brokerages. These institutions depend on the retail trader's money and require a steady supply of ""traders"" who pay them money through Fees, margin, spread, losses, and other ways including stop-loss hunting, data mining, taking the opposite position as the traders and other underhand means.The steady stream of new traders are deliberately misinformed through brokerage courses, social media educators, youtube traders, and forums that teach the public ""knowledge"" regarding technical indicators, which stock to pick, etc. This builds the public's confidence in their trading skills and they press the buy or sell button like sheep walking into the slaughterhouse.Often, these YouTubers(Always have a link to the brokerage in the description) have contracts with the brokerages to market to new customers, and forums are paid by the brokerages to push their narrative(ads). Fake profiles, sock puppets, and echo chambers are a few more ways to deceive the public.The key points to note are 1. **Conflict of Interest** between brokers and traders 2. Presence of an **intermediary**(brokerage) and 3. **Disinformation** through channels of information like TV, Social Media, Peers, etc.

&#x200B;

This narrative can be extended to almost all other aspects of human existence.

**Politics** \- Politicians are the intermediary between you and the state and often spew disinfo to get you to vote for them. their conflict of interest arises as they need to placate their backers and investors and not their voters.

**Healthcare** \- Doctors are the intermediary between you and health(clear disinfo) and prescribe you medicines to placate their backers(pharma industry) which often have bad effects on you(conflict of interest)

**Education** \- Teachers are the intermediary between you and a good job. They push all kind of disinfo on the young students and mould their minds into conformist slaves due to the requirements of the industry(conflict of interest)

**Religion** \- Pope is the intermediary between you and God (how they got away with this is beyond comprehension) and often spews disinfo to the believers that keep them in line and good slaves to the system.

**Secular Media** \- Intermediary between you and the news, conflict of interest due to political and financial backers and will not provide you with true or relevant news. Has an overall negative effect on the viewer.

&#x200B;

With the internet, it has become easier than ever before, to spread disinformation and lie to millions with a single click. How? All of these narratives are spread on numerous websites, forums and social media on the internet and countless people are fooled and misled into participating or giving consent to activities that actually do not serve their best interests and in some cases even harm them.

We should note that with all this censorship, inverted narratives and general negativity, we should be extremely careful when reading stuff on the internet and ""Feeding"" our minds with the ""news feed"" which is more or less peddling misinformation, lies and keeps the reader in a state of doubt and fear. On the other, disconnecting from the internet and going out for an hour in nature for a walk will do wonders to your psyche.

&#x200B;

With that said, we can take a look at How to Recognize Disinformation and countermeasures.

Disinfo Signatures:

1. Arguments starting with ""many people"", ""The consensus is"" etc. The collective consciousness, **group think**, hive mind are most of the time deluded and mistaken. (Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to reform (or pause and reflect).- Mark Twain 1904
2. Only talks about views or feelings without any **solutions**.                                                           *Proverbs 18:2 Fools find no pleasure in understanding but delight in airing their own opinions.*
3. Quick to **deny or malign** others who do not share their point of view(shoot the messenger).
4. **Threatening or bullying** while making arguments to persuade you to believe or follow their narrative
5. **Manipulative statement**s like ""dont you want this to stop?"", ""I would do ABC if i were you"", ""dont you believe/trust me?"" and ""many people can tell you that ABCD"" etc
6. Statements like ""are you okay?"", ""we are **concerned** for you"" etc but with **no constructive criticism nor attempts at finding possible solutions.**
7. **inconsistency in words and narratives like statements without proof.**
8. “**Crow’s Law**: Do not believe what you want to believe until you know what you ought to know.”
9. **Occam’s Razor**: Hypotheses are not to be multiplied without necessity. Given missing, ambiguous, and contradictory information, analysts should seek the simplest hypotheses that will account for the information on hand.
10. ""**Crabtree’s Bludgeon**: No set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated. human ability to make too much out of too little.
11. Through experience and analysis, one can often **predict the source of disinformation and the ""scheme"" of the false narrative.**
12. Disjointed incongruities “involve inconsistencies that have become, in the perceptions of the viewer if not in fact, separated or mismatched.” The incongruities are not recognized because the different sets of inconsistent patterns are never paired. Jokes, hoaxes, and deceptions all rely on disjointed incongruities. In this case, observer A perceives situation A and observer B perceives situation B. It may be the case that situations A and B are representations of the same situation, but unfortunately, this situation is not the true situation, C.  For example, Person A believes that Republicans will fix the economy, Person B believes that the Democrats will fix the economy when in fact, they are 2 sides of the same coin.
13. “The pairing of two or more apparently inconsistent patterns that represent a consistent underlying reality.” These complicate the task of incongruity testing by adding clutter to the process. They can result from different perspectives of the underlying pattern or as the result of our ability to detect order in random patterns. For example, Conspiracy A talks about Reptilians and NWO, Conspiracy B talks about NWO and 13 bloodlines => bloodliners are reptilians.
14. Never rely exclusively on nonmaterial evidence.
15. Never rely on agents who have not been seen or directly interviewed.
16. Check and double-check discrepancies in agent reporting

&#x200B;

Counter-Deception:

1. We should note that for deception and disinformation to work, the deceiver should try to control as many of the channels available to the target as possible. This includes books, social media, education systems, news channels etc.
2. Making assumptions and predictions explicit; it is easier for the target to maintain preexisting beliefs even in the face of evidence that contradicts those beliefs implying that it is important to examine one’s own beliefs for exploitable weaknesses in order to be less susceptible to deception.
3. The use of devil’s advocates; to emphasize the need for encouraging the “formulation and application of alternative images” noting that it is often politically and psychologically difficult for any one person to consider multiple alternatives.
4. Making sure that identities and missions do not become linked with specific theories and images; This is often seen in spiritual and alien ascension related conspiracies.
5. Awareness of common misperceptions. (inversion narrative)
6. Consider alternative views and narratives - instead of trying to eliminate cognitive biases altogether, decision-makers should take advantage of them in order to produce differing perspectives of a given situation.
7. • First the deception target identifies inconsistencies between his observations and his expectations for the observations. • The target then determines that those inconsistencies are functional to the goals of the deceiver. • Finally, the deception target identifies the potential actions of the deceiver that can be associated with one or more deception tactics and assesses the deceiver’s ability to create the observed inconsistencies.
8. The plus-minus rule - A single false characteristic—either one the real entity does not possess (a plus) or one it lacks (a minus) —is sufficient to prove the entity is fake.
9. The congruity-incongruity rule - Real entities are completely congruent with all of their characteristics; therefore, every false entity will display at least one incongruity.
10. Verification - It is always possible to find a way to verify a hypothesis.
11. The law of multiple sensors - Multiple sensors will almost always prove more effective than a single one, even when each is less precise
12. Passive and active detection - Deception may be detected by analysis (passive) supported by active intervention aimed at collecting missing key facts. This intervention takes the form of defining new collection requirements or by running controlled experiments, including the use of traps and tripwires, to trick the adversary into betraying himself.
13. Predetection - Predicting an adversary’s deception plans by analysis of his deceptive style, capabilities, and goals
14. Penetration and counterespionage - The adversary’s deception plans can be discovered through the use of penetrating the adversary’s organization with human agents or technical collection devices and discovering the deceiver’s double agents within one's own organizations.
15. The prepared mind and intuition - The ability to not only discover the meaning of chance events but to also make effective use of that knowledge depends wholly on systematic mental preparation. Such mental preparation also makes intuition possible.
16. Indirect thinking and the third option - The goal of indirect thinking is to come up with an indirect answer—the third option that the adversary was not expecting.
17. Bubsy's Ombudsman - “The essence of the Ombudsman Method is to force one to confront straight on that nagging, almost subliminal, sense of unease about a situation or person that somehow does not seem quite right, that does not quite fit as it should those little incongruities that signal a deception in progress”
18. Searching for common themes in the disinfo - I have found that almost all narratives, specifically conspiracy theories, have the reader in a state of fear, anger, helplessness and frustration due to the projection of power and authority with no justice for the victims and punishments for the perpetrators in sight. eg: 9/11, Pedogate, Bengahzi, Watergate, Targeted Individuals, NWO etc.

&#x200B;

“In religion and politics people’s beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second-hand, and without examination, from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue but have taken them at second-hand from other non-examiners, whose opinions about them were not worth a brass farthing.”

\-Mark Twain

&#x200B;

Sun Tzu's Art of War

1. Know thyself - this is where we lose because our system exploits a **lack of self-awareness** to exploit us all. As TIs we have it even worse and it is up to us to ""emancipate ourselves from mental slavery"".
2. Know thy enemy - focus on **exaggerations of strength and concealment of weakness**
3. Know your situation - We are in the minority and can expect no help from the system so we must be on top of our game and give the enemy no footholds to drag us down.
4. Know your channels - channels of information like MSM, social media, books, forums etc are mostly infiltrated, and disinformation is spread here. You should use discernment and wisdom to gauge the nature of the information you read and see if it helps you or just makes you feel bad as is often the case.

All Time Travel hypothetical scenarios need to start with the reality, if it is possible to do with the human ape meatsack. In ""The Terminator"" the premise was the only thing that could  make it through the reverse time travel portal was living organic tissue, which preposterously somehow covered up all the metal underneath.  
  
The human ape meatsack is very fragile. Since the travel in time must also involve the travel through space, any physical time travel, accelerated or reversed, is impossible. However, the signals of whatever existed will still be there, and if a probe goes to where things were, it may be able to simulate what was there. The probe will have to transport through macro-quantum entanglement, to be where things were, instantaneously with instantaneous transport. There are results indicating a mass inside a laminar flow plasma container does not experience inertia.  
  
As for reverse time travel, we experience that whenever we look up at the stars at night. We see them where they were, relative to their distance. The information about the star is thousands of years old, in our present. What will happen is what has been speculated before, the hypothetical aliens 70 light-years away, that are now receiving the TV signals from 1950, so they are now seeing ""The Jack Benny Show"". It was broadcast from omnidirectional antenna towers and strong enough to go through the ionosphere.

Management in the 1990s was focused on business process re-engineering: reducing activities to individual processes, streamlining and standardising those so that they could be automated, outsourced or in other ways modularised. The outcome was lower costs, utterly standardised products and supply chain integration across national boundaries. A secondary outcome was that jobs were rendered tedious and routine, or simply destroyed. Firms discounted anything that was not tangible and immediate, and so very literally threw away their brains in redundancy. They often re-hired these same brains in consultancy, where the job was generally done badly and superficially s insight went out of date and ideas grew stale. 


Hamel and Zanini recommend a reversal of this process. ""It wedges people into narrow roles, stymies personal growth and treats human beings as mere resources."" Businesses should split into small teams, with members thinking like business people. This allows individuals to apply their local knowledge and ingenuity. These teams should be motivated by local balance sheets, being able to negotiate prices and costs with other units. The book, as your would expect from Hamel, is full of examples: Haier, Nucor, Svenska Handelsbanken. Buurtzorg is a Dutch health providers, which has divided itself into more than a thousand teams, which engage in self management, being responsible for marketing ad recruitment as well as service delivery. The whole thing is overseen by a central staff of just a hundred people. 


My concern is how this can be synchronised if the guiding principle are lost: the ""V"" word, vision. It relies on excellent leadership and the communication of non-verbal notions of ""who we are and what we want to become"", couched in terms that are meaningful to all employees. We are not very good at delivering this, and do not train our senior statff to think and speak in this way.",0

Though hear me out, even if you don't agree. 

I think social media is not a bad thing. I don't think that it is a loudspeaker that allows bad information to spread. Rather, I think it is a flashlight that shows us just how much bad information, or how much ignorance, exists. 

Similar to how increasing testing can increase the number of C-19 cases we find, I think social media can expose just how much bad information we all believe to be true. But I think it is primarily showing us what already exists, rather than generating more. 

I don't think it's that ""the sheep are being misled"". I think that collectively, we are far more ignorant than we think we are. And social media shows us to this in a very uncomfortable transparent way.

Then, in my view, social media is not making us dumber, it's actually making us more aware of how dumb we have always been. 

And that makes sense to me. The internet just arrived. Before this, you would develop a few views, just enough to sustain your life, and that was it. Today, you are able to develop such deep and complex views on things, that we can now differentiate between good and bad views on an individual level. I think that's a new thing

To me, this is an important step towards ""The Singularity"". First, we have to find ourselves. Social media is a part of that process. And then once we find ourselves, we have to accept what it is we find. I think we're currently going through that process.

And once we accept ourselves, I think we'll see social media very differently. But for now, I think our anger directed towards social media is more the denial phase of grief than anything else. 

Currently, I see growing popularity in the view that social media is at the heart of all our problems. And I think that view has a lot to do with the political divisions in the US. Divisions which I've seen building since long before social media was a thing.

The growing trend of blaming social media concerns me, as it is too close to anti-progress and anti-technology related views.

Of course, I recognize how fringe this view is. Thus I expect this post will end up in the downvoted heaps. But the growing trend of blaming social media was bugging me. I wanted to write out why I felt that way. And here it is.",0

 You're now on the internet more than you aren't on the internet, instead of just using it for school or work.

 Today, you can talk on the phone and use the internet at the same time.

 You no longer have to worry about breathing in secondhand smoke when going out to eat.

 You now get more excited about television than you do about movies.

 You no longer have to sit around hoping your Napster song download goes through.

 You rent movies off Amazon Prime instead of heading to Blockbuster.

 Eating at a restaurant has become a social experience.

 You can no longer go on vacation and truly take a break from everything.

 Many people see terrorist attacks a more of a looming threat today.

 You probably also have a much bigger fear of mass shootings today than you did 20 years ago.

 You now get updates from the president of the United States on Twitter.

 You no longer have to memorize anyone's phone numbers.

 You text instead of leaving voicemails.

 Everyone has a smartphone, and most people don't even know what a Nokia is.

 You have to take your shoes off when you fly now.

 Online dating is the norm today.

 You have the option to watch television without commercials.

 You now take photos on your cell phone instead of a film camera.

 You use Google Chrome instead of Internet Explorer.

 You make playlists instead of burning CDs.

 The global population has exploded.

 And more and more people are living in cities.

 Buildings are reaching previously unimaginable heights.

 The internet has changed the way we do … everything.

 Social media has taken over.

 People no longer believe in banks.

 Climate change is becoming a grim reality.

As this trend continues, further advancements across the board abound through further investment in these sectors. Sadly, these stories get lost behind the ""news that sells"". From energy advancements to AI memristor hardware to a successful interstellar solar sail test, September was a great month!

Here are the top stories from the past month (in mostly chronological order):

# 1. [NuScale’s small nuclear reactor is first to get US safety approval](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/first-modular-nuclear-reactor-design-certified-in-the-us/)

*Ars Technica*

One hope buoying nuclear energy advocates has been the promise of “small modular reactor” designs. By dividing a nuclear facility into an array of smaller reactors, they can largely be manufactured in a factory and then dropped into place, saving us from having to build a complex, possibly one-of-a-kind behemoth on site. That could be a big deal for nuclear’s persistent financial problems, while also enabling some design features that further improve safety.

# 2.  [Microsoft launches a deepfake detector tool ahead of US election](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/microsoft-launches-a-deepfake-detector-tool-ahead-of-us-election/)

*TechCrunch*

Microsoft  has added to the slowly growing pile of technologies aimed at spotting synthetic media (aka deepfakes) with the launch of a tool for analyzing videos and still photos to generate a manipulation score. The tool, called Video Authenticator, provides what Microsoft calls “a percentage chance, or confidence score” that the media has been artificially manipulated.

# 3. [Brain-Inspired Electronic System Could Make Artificial Intelligence 1,000 Times More Energy Efficient](https://scitechdaily.com/brain-inspired-electronic-system-could-make-artificial-intelligence-1000-times-more-energy-efficient/)

*SciTech Daily*

Extremely energy-efficient artificial intelligence is now closer to reality after a study by UCL researchers found a way to improve the accuracy of a brain-inspired computing system. The system, which uses memristors to create artificial neural networks, is at least 1,000 times more energy efficient than conventional transistor-based AI hardware, but has until now been more prone to error.

# 4.  [NASA Study Proposes Airships, Cloud Cities for Venus Exploration](https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/nasa-study-proposes-airships-cloud-cities-for-venus-exploration)

*IEEE Spectrum*

It's been 35 years since a pair of robotic balloons explored the clouds of Venus. The Soviet Vega 2 and Vega 2 probes didn't manage to find any Venusians, but that may have been because we didn't know exactly what to look for. On 14 September 2020, a study published in Nature suggested that traces of phosphine in Venus' atmosphere could be an indication of a biological process: that is, of microbial alien life. If confirmed, such a finding could completely change the way we think about the universe, which has us taking a serious look at what it would take to get human explorers to Venus in the near future.

# 5.  [Stores in Japan Are Stocking Shelves With Remote-controlled Robots](https://futurism.com/the-byte/stores-japan-stocking-shelves-remote-controlled-robots)

*Futurism*

Two major convenience store franchises in Japan are testing out robots capable of stocking shelves using two creepy hands with three “fingers” each, CNN reports. The seven-foot is called Model-T, named after the Ford automobile that triggered a car revolution in the early 1900s, and was developed by Japanese startup Telexistence. During a pilot program, it was controlled by a “pilot” in an office miles away.

# 6. [IBM Unveils Quantum Roadmap, Plans 1,000-Qubit Chip by 2023](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/315020-ibm-unveils-quantum-roadmap-plans-1000-qubit-chip-by-2023)

*ExtremeTech*

IBM is one of the companies jockeying for position in the nascent field of quantum computing and the company thinks it has a roadmap to develop a universal quantum computer with up to 1,000 qubits. Such a chip would be capable of more complex workloads than any existing chip. Furthermore, IBM claims that even this 1,000-qubit CPU, codenamed Quantum Condor, is just the beginning, with long-term plans for a “million-plus” qubit chip at some unspecified point in the future.

# 7. [VIDEO: The Future of Fission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baQelfQAH54)

*Isaac Arthur | YouTube*

Nuclear Fission was once hailed as the solution to our power & energy needs, but has grown unpopular of fears of radiation, meltdowns, and radioactive waste. However, advances in science and reactor design may make atomic energy safer and more attractive in the future.

# 8. [Researchers have developed the world’s smallest ultrasound detector - It is smaller than the size of a blood cell](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/en/aktuelles/latest-news/press-information-news/article/48828/index.html)

*Helmholtz Zentrum München*

Researchers at Helmholtz Zentrum München and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have developed the world’s smallest ultrasound detector. It is based on miniaturized photonic circuits on top of a silicon chip. With a size 100 times smaller than an average human hair, the new detector can visualize features that are much smaller than previously possible, leading to what is known as super-resolution imaging.

*Universe Today*

The challenge of any space journey comes down to delta-v. That is, how much you can change your speed relative to the speed of Earth. To gain delta-v, you need to have some kind of thrust. Rockets are a great way to get delta-v, but they have one big downside. Rocket fuel needs to be carried with you, and that means the faster you want to go the more fuel you need to carry. In other words, the greater the delta-v, the greater your mass to payload ratio.

*The Register*

The US government is continuing its crusade against Huawei, with economic undersecretary Keith Krach visiting Berlin to pressure the German government to reconsider banning the company’s kit from its 5G network. Krach reportedly told Angela Merkel and her advisers that including Huawei equipment in its next-generation networks could even put the future of NATO at risk, repeating the US government’s position that Huawei represents a national security threat. He recommended Nokia and Ericsson kit instead.

*Futurism*

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has revealed plans to extract hydrogen from the Moon’s ice deposits to use as a fuel source, the major Tokyo-based newspaper Japan Times reports. The goal is to cut costs during the nation’s planned lunar explorations in the mid-2030s by creating a fuel source locally rather than lugging copious amounts of fuel all the way from Earth.",0

This lack of knowledge coupled with the utter manipulation by mass popular media has caused our society to return to utilizing crystals, mythology , and superstition to explain the complexities of the world . the scary part is famous astronomer Carl Sagan actually predicted this as his dark foreboding in his 1995 book the Demon Haunted world which reveals that the American society is regressing back to the dark ages ,and it is describing our current situation in 2020.",0

Usually electrolysis is paired with renewable energy to mitigate concerns about the process using large amounts of energy which will come from fossil fuels. It sounds great, but I have questions about the environmental impact.

If we drain lakes and rivers and split up the water, would that not permanently remove the water from the hydrosphere? Is there any risk of widespread use of electrolysis causing water shortages? Would this make electrolysis impractical for areas that don’t have large amounts of water? And unrelated, does the water have to be pure, or can you get waste water and run it through the electrolysis process?

Edit: and what if you use the hydrogen to produce steel like I’ve been seeing?",0

I think micro-cities will begin to form.

I regularly report those posts, and I have sent a private message to the mods--all of which has gone unanswered.  So I am posting, and once again asking for the mods to either enforce the rules, or change them (and while you're at it, you may as well change the name of the group).  

If there are any mods left--I am still waiting for your response.",0

Humans will be involved with the evolution of many plants and other animals.

In other words, we are in the process of taking over our own evolution; we have already manipulated and changed genes within the Human genome. ... 
Genetic engineering will result in the remaking of man...millions of years of evolution telescoped into a few centuries.

While it sounds far-fetched. Seriously to connect these dots does come off insane. However, looking back during the time elapsed and now, crazy as it sounds I’d say everything is on track. Put on your tin foil hat Dorothy because this loon is going to take you for a ride. 

Out of respect, first here is the **\*TLDR\* How the world or the very least humanity comes in to an end.   \*TLDR\***

When I used to smoke one of the benefits was going outside and have a conversation with a complete stranger. I’ve met many people that way. I always felt comfortable approaching strangers to have a smoke with, even as an introvert. Made a couple smoke buddies as well and we’d try to coronate smoke schedules. 

Fast forward a couple years with the introduction of smart phones. Not only can you not have a conversation but even if you make a movement that is distracting you will upset and offend a person on said device because you’ve broken their immersion from it. 

That’s about the time I started picking up on the signs. As the years progressed it seems that people started to distance themselves from strangers and act in a cruel or aggressive manner towards other people.

Growing up in the 1980s you were taught morals. Share, take care of others, look out for one another, be a good person, do the right thing. Over time all of those things are pretty much gone. 

First there was health care. Need a life sustaining drug? 800% Mark up. Balanced billing pitfalls and traps to catch you intentionally. Example E.R visit after math, insurance has to pay but they won’t “Sorry sir, the doctor on call wasn’t on our network. So you want to hand over your house now, or would you prefer lawyer fees on top of that? If you do it the easy way your family can at least eat something tonight”.

Next there was destroying church. Church and state was always separate. While I’m not a religious person at all, I can appreciate the template and morals they had laid out on what to follow to “be a good person”. Granted not all of them were rainbows and unicorns but a good start. A majority of that stuff had value and would help keep a society in check.  That is after all what region is for in my opinion, just a tool of control.  If you really think about it, that’s an amazing and yet powerful tool to wield. 

The problem is church had its own laws and principles. The government couldn’t control that and church is a conflict of interest. With it, no one could capitalize off doing things immoral without bible thumpers complaining, there’s enough of them to cause a problem. 

Church has become a liability, tax free, free room and board at some if you needed it.  Even therapy also free. Can’t profit off that. But also people expressing their right to free speech related to its laws. This had to stop, there is only to do that. The government broke rank and went after those that followed the church practices such as refusing service for same sex couples. 

When the government came down hard on the system. The church was no longer a moral and proud member of a noble society, but rather immoral for refusing service to gay rights, and drudging up decades of content related to it.  All absolutely intended. 

By design the church was no longer influential. Now true capitalism in full form can take shape for max greed action. 

Almost everyone today by design is greedy, self-centered, morals no longer have value. As long as you can capitalize off taking advantage of someone do it. That’s the new way. Fuck you, your life and everything in it, just so long I can make a buck. 

Try are new “unlimited” service today! The word unlimited laser focuses expectations of said service but that’s not what you received is it? Intended, long as I can make a buck. Or “long as I get mine” for short. 

Don’t forget about the justice system using these tactics. Not allowing evidence in court. Purposely setting the stage for your word vs the police. Who is the jury going to believe? “Long as I get mine”.

If you gamed back in the day online someone would help you on your journey and you’d pay it forward. Today? Pay me if you want help. 

Recently I’ve noticed a rise of defending manipulative, immoral capitalism and dominating a good natured person.  In fact those that pull off a successful heist via ruining someone’s life by means of taking advantage on a kind natured soul people seem to go ape shit crazy over it.  Being a good or nice person is now considered a weakness and deserves to be capitalized on according to the world. 

Just think about how many subs here support that style of encouragement and how much people enjoy seeing other people suffer. 

Looking back from 2008 to 2020, that’s really not that much time. But things sure have gone downhill rapidity. This style of behavior has already turned predatory in that time frame. 

How long do you think we have left? H",0

Just wanted to get your feedback on a website I am currently designing for people with disabilities and startups. I believe its a really important design aspect we should be addressing now and for the future.

[https://includability.webflow.io/](https://includability.webflow.io/)

There's also a slack community- [https://join.slack.com/t/includability/shared\_invite/zt-hl67w7c5-fybaSjtT4C1z8n2c2FONYQ](https://join.slack.com/t/includability/shared_invite/zt-hl67w7c5-fybaSjtT4C1z8n2c2FONYQ) and would love to see what you think of it!

The link above is a continuation of the project and would love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you can provide.

Particularly in its usability/suitability for users with and without disabilities. Although the website is still a work in progress.

Feel free to share this with anyone that might be interested.

Cheers,

(I'm wondering if you could use geothermal techniques to push Fusion into viability using existing confinement techniques like magnetic/ inertial/ lattice confinement etc.)


I'm clearly not saying that pressure would be enough, although we have seen some evidence that fusion might be occurring naturally. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1019331615020070
I'm wondering if perhaps using one of the existing techniques like magnetic confinement / inertia confinement might be augmented by the natural pressures / heat under the Earth? Clearly such a reactor should be designed with upmost care, and only with absolute understanding of the geology involved. I imagine something like inertial confinement with the laser fired into a long skinny funnel of a hole. Maybe with magnetic confinement along the side of the hole. Maybe you could even make the target using the lattice confinement technique. 

You could design it as a sort of U shape with one side loaded up with water that would be heated by the fusion. I do apologize if this all seems absurd. It just dawned on me that there is tons of potential energy that could be utilized. A sort of hybrid geothermal/ fusion power plant.",0

Vardi Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Ken Kennedy Institute for Information Technology at Rice University, for the free ACM TechTalk, ""[Lessons from COVID-19: Efficiency vs Resilience](https://webinars.on24.com/acm/vardi?partnerref=red).""

In both computer science and economics, efficiency is a cherished property. In computer science, the field of algorithms is almost solely focused on their efficiency. In economics, the main advantage of the free market is that it promises ""economic efficiency."" A major lesson from COVID-19 is that both fields have over-emphasized efficiency and under-emphasized resilience. In this talk, Prof. Vardi argues that resilience is a more important property than efficiency and discusses how the two fields can broaden their focus to make resilience a primary consideration

It is observed both in humans and in other domesticated animals.

If one was to extrapolate this trend, then here is a possible future.

I am not saying that it is certainly how things are going to be, I am simply asking you to entertain this possibility.

We are approximately in the adolescence state. After adolescence comes childhood.

All watched over by machines of loving grace.

All needs met by a generous unconditional basic income.

Birthrate continues to decrease until in eventually approaches zero.

The deathrate as well (see r/longevity), we all perpetually enjoy indefinite healthspan.

The human population size remains constant.

But it's influence is drowned in the rising sea of artificial intelligence.

And so we gradually become obsolete, irrelevant when it comes to decision-making.

Maybe the next step after that?

After childhood comes infancy. Post-linguistic enlightenment in the everlasting now.

It can come in symbiosis with the AI, this is not excluded.

This does not sound very good, but not very bad either.

It just sounds very weird, as the future is supposed to be.

Don't know if that community could exist in a robocab future. You'd have to vocally command the cab left, right, etc to get to your destination. I don't even know if an EV could get through that kind of mud. All that weight would probably sink it on a rainy day.

Given the questionable legal status and the historically contentious relationship with the county, they could literally censor travel to and from the area.

My reasoning is that with EVERYONE is now able to tell their stories of celebrity encounters, good or bad. Along with this, fans are faced with more information about their favorite celebrity as well.

Ellen is a great example of how knowledge is power but also can ruin joy to an extent. Before the age of outrage culture and internet doxing, someone like Ellen would have never been thought of as being secretly mean. Her staff and former staff used twitter to fully express their problems with her.

She’s not just an isolated example. All I am saying is that celebrity culture will die down because the truth is easily realized nowadays. Part of what made guys like Prince and the Beatles so popular was the fact that they were unaccessible to the point that they were perfect living legends. Not that easy to pull off mystique and hide your true colors anymore.
What do you all think?

1) I've followed David Sinclair closely on anti-aging for awhile now. He seems to believe aging could ""stop"" here soon because of medical advancements. Has anybody heard anything similar or is he crazy?

This seems so simple, but I can't see why optical tweezers couldn't be just as real of a barrier as a metal plate. Photons don't have charge so that part works. I'm sure the optical tweezers would have to be far more powerful then those that are in use now, however if we used holographic technology could you even extract tiny amounts of anitmatter?

I know I'm probably missing something obvious so please let me know what it is.",0

This paper looks at what happens when algorithms in companies are responsible for criminal conduct.

https://youtu.be/L5pUA3LsEaw
This video gets closest at all, but he skipped over what happens when corporations get access to the sort of AI that we now corporations now have. He then decided they weren't super intelligent after ignoring one of the things that could give them super intelligence.

We call them corporations, and when they are small and person centered they seem to be under control, but after a while and due to the inevitable interactions with the environment/ market forces they take on a life of their own. Eventually people start doing ""what's best for the corporation"" and at that point they are at least a partner worthy of consideration. There are patterns of abuse / behavior that keep happening over and over again in history. However because they run on corporate time and not human time we are oblivious to those tendencies.

You can go back to the Dutch East India company for instance, and all the brutality and evil they created in their lifetime. All of the people enslaved, and countries looted. Yes the people running those companies have moral culpability, but I'm sure they would tell you the classic if I wasn't doing it someone else line. Or maybe they would insist that they are trying to better these people in their own twisted minds. That's what the profit motive does to people. It makes them inevitably justify the unjustifiable.

My point is no person in a company is actually as free as we make them out to be. You can look at a CEO for instance, and think he's the most free of all. However all of that comes with inevitable constraints. He has to make decisions based on the market, and he has to answer to the shareholders. Shareholders who by and large may just be leaders of hedge funds.
So you have so much detachment from the actual consequences, and the people whom you talk to have a fiduciary obligation to their clients. Do you see how questions of whats the right thing to do might be low on peoples priorities?

Add to that you have multiple levels to a corporation. Who acts threw all its employees who are also responding to forces. Some like I was might just be severely mentally ill. So what the company actually does isn't really up to anyone person. For consistency you need what's called a corporate culture. That culture can develop just like any other individual into a toxic horrible mess of vile evil, or it can be a place trying to make a difference that for now is doing good, but you never do really know. My point is that corporate culture isn't really under anyone's control either. You can do things to try and influence that culture like for example at the extreme end fire a ton of staff, but that is an expensive proposition as well. Your also just rolling the dice that the next people you hire will be better so maybe the evil you know...

What bothers me most is that no one seems to actually be taking this idea seriously. No matter how in depth people talk about it there is this sort of sliperyness to the idea for seemingly most people. Look back in our history and behind every atrocity you will find at least one corporation acting in a highly unethical manner. Its there every fucking time. Every single battle field. Every single genocide. Racisim/ sexisim, and just about every other isim has corporate backers or it wouldn't exist anymore.

This is going to be a long read, but I promise that it isn't filled with fluff but more the line of thinking that gets me excited about the long term future. I see so much talk of UFOs flying around social media and have read into it some myself. It isn't so much if UFOs are real or not, but it always gets me thinking about extraterrestrial intelligence.

I think that as human beings we are extremely constrained in our ability to understand what having varying levels of intelligence means. Our scales are very limited because it more or less goes something like: bacteria (completely perceptually 'to us' chemically driven), ants (ability to perform complex routed tasks even with a small nervous system, however limited ability to diverge from this preset ability via problem solving), mouse (small animal with a small nervous system that can accomplish simple problem solving tasks), dog (varying levels of intelligence per breed, but can solve much more complex tasks than a mouse, have some emotional intelligence of humans, can react to the most basic use of language to varying degrees), dolphins (strong inter species emotional intelligence, can solve complex tasks that lie between dog and primate level, closest non-primate to humans in intelligence), certain primates (can solve generally complex tasks well beyond all other non-humans, can solve some relatively complex tasks that outperform humans up to a certain age, strong inter species emotional intelligence, highest observed primate intelligence can arguably correspond somewhere around -2 to -1 std human in some ways.)

My point is that this is where our scale falls flat. We can only compare each person in the very limited scope of what we can observe. This might mean knowing someone who can solve math problems a little faster or someone who picks up on math problems a little faster (in your personal life). The difference doesn't seem that big and objectively it isn't that big. Now on a relative scale the difference is big because of how increased intelligence leads to compounding effects over time and the ability to learn things that other people may never be able to understand, but the scale is only relatively significant. The reality is that people at the top end can hold around 2-3x the working memory and process information at most a few times faster than lower (but not mentally handicapped) std people. This also includes a general ability to perceive, understand and pick up on more complex information. If anything had intelligence that was higher by the same magnitude as we are to primates, it wouldn't personally care that much because it wouldn't notice much of a difference between people in general because the gap is so large. The reality is that computation can hold many orders of magnitude higher levels of cognitive ability than the human brain can. Unfathomable to us. However, this isn't what I am interested in for this post.

One thing that the UFO phenomenon keeps reminding me of is biological constraints and possibility. The reality is that Earth is just one experiment of evolution with only ONE organism that has reached a fatally dominant level of intelligence. This opens a can of worms that requires me to slow down a little. First of all, we could have had a more intelligent proto-human become dominant. Remember that many mutations create new branches of biological reality while also closing other branches. One mutation that acutely lead to Homosapien intelligence could have fatally reduced the maximum intelligence that we could have ever evolved to while Neanderthals (or other proto-human populations) could have had a much higher potential. This is completely theoretical, but its to make the possibility clear. Humans also speculatively had a huge bottleneck event 70,000 years ago that dropped the population down to 2,000-10,000 which highly restricts the mutations that had developed over 10s of thousands of years that could have lead to much higher spontaneous intelligence (the right combinations of the many unique mutations.) The reality is even with this huge bottleneck event occurring, we still have a wide mix of intelligence profiles in the 21st century, but it also requires billions of people to find some of our outliers.

So we've realized that Earth has had many experiments when it comes to the totality of evolved life and variety, but an extremely limited profile of outlier intelligence. Humans took a very short time to develop even in terms of how long Earth has had to run evolution. Now the next big problem besides how bottlenecked and possibly limited we are maximally from intelligence is the environment that humans were selected from. The three main features that I find when pondering why we became so dominant are: high enough base general intelligence, high enough emotional intelligence, right anatomical design to take advantage of both. These are the three key ingredients and honestly, the challenge wasn't that high. The evolutionary path required that we learn how to solve tasks a step higher than animals, have a decent memory, communicate fluently with each other and be able to hold and manipulate tools. I'm basically saying that how intelligent we evolved always came down to the environment that challenged us which is basic natural selection. I don't think that the selection was that high on this planet. We didn't have to spend millions of years evolving intelligence high enough to compete with other proto-humans in a quasi red queen scenario because we won out in a short period of time. We've hit the sufficient level of intelligence to become dominant and no longer is that a real pressure.

So now we are stuck at a certain biological intelligence cap. Intelligence = the pace of innovation. I think that a lot of us realize this already, but it has a clear and direct correlation. We can still make amazing progress, but the more problems you solve, the harder the new ones.

Here is the final piece of the puzzle. Earth is one evolutionary experiment that was honestly pretty inefficient at producing highly intelligent organisms. Humans might have been a lucky accident for all we know. There's no way of knowing if anything even close to us has existed on this planet before, but it seems unlikely simply because of the current environment (with us being uncontested.) It's clear that there is no abundance of human like organisms on Earth. Now what happens when you run this experiment billions of times with different starting settings and mechanisms of genetic code? Well the obvious answer is that you could have other human like intelligences, but that answer is boring. You could have some planets that hit the jackpot early and are filled with loads of intelligent, human like life and if that already becomes standard, then by nature there will be outliers that outstrip all of the rest by a wide margin. When you have billions of planet experiments to run, you end up creating the outliers of outliers and having some organisms that are much more efficient. That's why we can have two different people with the same sized brain, but one being much more intelligent than the other. Well the same thing is going to happen in accord with millions of different highly intelligent species with millions of different mutations and starting points that branch differently. Not to mention that some planets could have unbelievably high selection standards in environments like this that Red Queen fully intelligent populations until one becomes dominant enough to win.

So at the end of the day, I'm not so much interested in intelligent life off this planet. What I am interested in is looking at the various routings of intelligence and evolution and the assumptions that you can make from them about the current limits of our biological intelligence. I am most excited with the idea of being able to recreate ourselves into extremely intelligent, customized biological beings. Now this might not take precedent over just entering the simulation, but it basically means we could upgrade our biology significantly as a means to have a natural intelligence boost as well. I guess it's that I like there being more than one route to upgrade ourselves.",0

>Three Laureates share this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics for their discoveries about one of the most exotic phenomena in the universe, the black hole. Roger Penrose showed that the general theory of relativity leads to the formation of black holes. Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez discovered that an invisible and extremely heavy object governs the orbits of stars at the centre of our galaxy. A supermassive black hole is the only currently known explanation.",1
