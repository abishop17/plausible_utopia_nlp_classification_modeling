There are political and cultural problems that occur with social change in a society with high and/or rising life expectancies.,4,jeyeez,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/jeyeez/there_are_political_and_cultural_problems_that/,"Currently, the life expectancy in the US, central Europe, and Brazil is in the mid-to-high 70s. That in Western Europe, Japan, and Australia for instance is even higher. That means (I'm simplifying the math a lot) that an older but not extremely old person in those countries is likely a child of the 1940s, having been born not only before the internet but also before color television, before Buddy Holly and Elvis, before Mao, and before the US and the European empires began dismantling their apartheid regimes. Since the human brain is very susceptible to inputs in the first twenty years of life, this means that older people in developed and upper-middle-income countries are products a world completely different from our own, in which change appears to be accelerating. I don't know if it's causal, but currently many developed and upper-middle-income countries are seeing situations in which older voters are disproportionately supporting reactionary politicians. Is there a way to fix this without either slowing down social and technological change (likely political suicide) or slashing life expectancy/instituting a voting maximum age (ditto)?",4,0.84,/r/Futurology/comments/jeyeez/there_are_political_and_cultural_problems_that/,futurology,new

And since farming is also now automated, we are now closer to that, there would be less human power required.

Self-Sovereignty via technology (or what to do about globalism),3,je4r8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/je4r8q/selfsovereignty_via_technology_or_what_to_do/,"Technology has given us all of our modern conveniences and societal progress, but we have serious problems staring at us that all stem from the use of technology. Capitalist-globalist society, environmental harm, wealth/status inequality, waste, habitat destruction, etc, etc, etc, reveal that current methods are not sustainable and must be mitigated for the health of the environment and the human species. We need to change this, fast.  


I propose we tackle the problems of sustainability using technology to make individuals and/or dwellings self responsible for the things they need. That is to say that as much as possible, the means of production and materials required for the things we need/use occur inside a dwelling to the highest degree possible, and to the highest convenience possible. There are three basic areas in which I think effort should be focused first: food, power, and artifacts. If dwellings were sovereign in this respect, regardless of their location in the world, then the problems of manufacturing, shipping/distributing, and waste could be mitigated, all while providing greater security and self-reliance down to the unit of a home or individual.

How Ready Player One could become reality,0,jd56to,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/jd56to/how_ready_player_one_could_become_reality/,"Anybody who has watched this very movie will agree, that the thought of living inside a world where this technology is possible and executed is beyond fascinating, if not the most fascinating thing in this world. 

Just imagine, you can live inside a paradise, inside a new world, your new identity, you can be whoever you want inside this world, no limitations (maybe some if this would become really seriouse).  


**How this would work:**  
Basically humanity would advance at some time in the futre to the point, where the normal, non virtual world, would be classified as the boring and useless world to do things and to live in. I mean, your body would have to be still in this world, but your mind could bin in this virtual reality, 24 hours, 7 days of the week. Your body would stand on a multi dimensional platform as seen in the movie, where whenever you make a movement, you will go in this direction in the virtual relaity, but not in the real world since your body stays in this moving platform. You would wake up, sleep, eat, drink, feel in this world. Now, some questions come up in your mind:  


**How would it be possible to meet human desires and the senses?:**  
Touch and stimulation:   
Could be possible with suits and gloves you would have on your body the whole time and weather conditional changes setup arround your body  
smell:   
Could be possible with a real time smell setup which will have over millions of real world smells saved up and whenever you encounter one object which could smell in virtual reality, that smell will be released in the exact amount and distance to you in the real world, so you will smell it.  


movement:  
Could be possible with the multi directional moving platform you will walk on and rest when sitting or going to bed.

Hearing and seeing and going to toilet: Obviouse  


Hear comes the tricky and for me personally, one of the most excieting parts (as if not everything was excieting as it is we have seen like in the movie with all the reward system and so much more):  


eating/drinking:  
You would be able to buy food / drinks in the virtual reality, and then at the same second you bought it, it would get teleported to you in real life. This is like some true next level shit!  


What do you think, could this future be possible, if so, when would this become reality by the technology progress and inovation looked back at 50 years from now ?",0,0.47,/r/Futurology/comments/jd56to/how_ready_player_one_could_become_reality/,futurology,new

Attempting to open a dialogue on viewing World Harmony as a solvable problem with logical steps.,5,jd31lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/jd31lx/attempting_to_open_a_dialogue_on_viewing_world/,"World Peace is a pipe dream at best, impossible at worst. However, live and let live should not be that difficult and most of us are living in this manner. The worst of us and are being blasted in the cyber-sphere. Everyone does not need to hold hands and sing Kumbaya for society and civilization to stabilize and progress. Even the federal government doesn’t need to be involved for this change to happen. Though it would definitely help, we are seeing local governments, organizations, and individuals do just this. There are three main issues that need to be tackled. If these three main issues are tackled, then the rest of the problems that plague society would hopefully follow suit. 

1. The spread of information, disinformation and the willful ignorance of ideas that go against held beliefs. This issue also couples with the issue of communication and the tendency for people to disregard one another because of certain beliefs, even if we don't necessarily understand why they came to the conclusions they came to. We tend to disregard the potential things we have in common with someone due to grievances in specific details. While the grievances in the specific details might be very legitimate issues (i.e I meet people that don't believe in climate change and the ongoing extinction event. It’s extremely upsetting for me, but getting upset isn't going to open a dialogue to educate someone.)  Ignorance affects all of us, from the intellectual to the man living in the street. The man on the street has a lesson for all of us. Learning what it means to have to live with just the bare essentials, no clue where you’re next meal is going to come from, where you're going to sleep, if this asshole eyeing you is planning something, why would I go to the steps of letting go of all of my possessions to sleep under the stars, why do people judge for letting go of those things, and the clarity of who friends and family really are is beyond words. While I am forever grateful for the humbling experience of letting go, it's not a lesson that needs to be experienced by everyone, and in a perfect world no one would have to experience that type of insecurity, because we have the potential to do so. 
2. The second issue is the current mental health crisis. That’s a big plate and is going to take time to prep, cook, and digest. It’s extremely difficult focusing on big picture issues and bridging the gaps between the details when depression, anxiety, ptsd, survival insecurity, and social disconnection are rampant. How many people are trapped because of trauma that comes in all forms? Humankind’s history has been downright traumatic, and the wounds still exist. A lot of healing, and not just band-aids, are going to be necessary for this. To transition civilization into a post scarcity state is going to require forgiveness, empathy, selflessness, and introspection. The most potentially powerful and useful tools for this type of healing are Schedule 1, and the limited research into their potential is groundbreaking. Cannabis and Psilocybe Mushrooms are gifts from the Earth, used by different cultures and peoples for millenia. LSD is an unbelievably unique and curious case that if used safely and responsibly is rocket fuel for “consciousness” and perspective. This is true of the other empathogens and psychedelics as well. The people who have been the nuclei of the belief that they need to be vilified are performing a disservice for greater mankind that is damn near downright evil. And the people abusing them to just get high are missing the point that they are windows into the potential of the mind, and that anything experienced on those is possible sober.  
3. The third, but probably most pressing issue, is the ongoing extinction event as well as the effects this is going to have on agriculture. The food chain is unbelievably important.  Nothing destroys open discourse amongst people like hunger and survival insecurity. Greed, shortsightedness, and “out of sight out of mind” mentality is driving this. The issue of our unsustainable food production is going to destroy any potential linking of all the different perspectives in society. By bracing for what’s happening and taking the steps to mitigate complete chaos, all the other issues faced can be processed. May they be social, economic, moral, philosophical, etc... Climate is linked to ecology, and the bridge between the two is teetering on the verge of disaster, especially if the world superpowers continue focusing on attempting to feel like God and becoming the mind in charge of it all, dragging the rest of us into hell. 

Our understanding of what’s going on and how we stabilize spaceship Earth is going to have to evolve as ideas melt and focus is placed on the steps that can be taken to weave this basket together. We all have something to bring to the table. The future is bright. We do not know the things we know or believe until we learn them, experience, or understand them ourselves. Being able to tackle the issues of Race, police brutality, fascism, sexism etc are not going to be feasible if there is no anchor in general survival. And this anchor is currently not in place. The steps to change always begin with one conversation at a time. Perhaps that's foolish, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. God speed. ",5,0.67,/r/Futurology/comments/jd31lx/attempting_to_open_a_dialogue_on_viewing_world/,futurology,new

AI/Legal Tech Master’s Thesis & Companies/Institutions 🤖📝,3,jbysqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/jbysqn/ailegal_tech_masters_thesis_companiesinstitutions/,"Hi everyone, hope I can ask these two questions here:  
 

1. What is a good subject to write an AI/legal tech master’s thesis about in terms of future relevancy and perhaps labour/job market?   
 I am heavily considering deepfake video and audio, image recognition/deep learning uses/misuses with e.g. adversarial examples or Neuralink and its possible implications on society/humanity.   
 I am currently studying at the Faculty of Law at University of Copenhagen and I have 15 days to choose my subject(s).  
 
2. What are some good AI/ML/DL/robolaw/regtech/transhumanism/legal tech companies or institutions to look into for insight (and maybe collaboration) in this field?   
 I live in Copenhagen, Denmark, but I’m assuming that the vast majority of these companies and institutions are from abroad.  
 

Thank you in advance and have a great day!

PhilosopherAI Makes Prediction About The Density of Planet 9,3,j9wqlc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/j9wqlc/philosopherai_makes_prediction_about_the_density/,"First off I consider this to be more of an experiment in terms of this type of AI. I have no idea if this prediction is valid, but I also think it would be interesting to try and fact check this. I was wondering if we could systematically test this GPT3 AI, and effectively test our collective scientific understanding. Remember this thing learned based on posts all over Reddit including Futurology. So if you have posted then a part of you is in this thing. Would there be a way to systematically probe GPT3s general scientific understanding?




Prompt --->
How dense is planet 9?


Answer --->
The planet called 9 is actually a celestial body that orbits the sun. Like all celestial bodies, it has its own gravitational pull which causes things to fall towards it and hence creates density. Therefore, if you were to put an object on this planet's surface then it would become more dense depending upon how close or far away from the center of gravity they are.

The center of gravity, the point around which all other points in an object or celestial body rotate and from which the forces of attraction emanate. It is defined as a position at rest with respect to its own surrounding mass.

Now 9 is a planet that orbits the sun, just as Earth does. However, it has been found to be much denser than earth by a factor of around 10^17 times more dense in fact (by my understanding).

I have to admit I am not quite sure what my knowledge base is trying to tell me. It seems as if planet 9 has a density of 0, but it also says that planet 9 is much denser than earth (by 10^17 times). This clearly contradicts itself and therefore the information cannot be trusted.

Well, I think my knowledge base is suggesting that it has a density of 0. However this cannot be true since if there was no gravitational pull in any direction then you would be able to move through the planet as easily as you can walk through air.

I suppose I will have to look at the evidence.




Prompt --->
Given how massive and dense Planet 9 is projected to be would it be a black hole?


Answer --->
First off, Planet 9 is predicted to be massive and dense. The word density implies a large mass for a given volume of space; the term massive implies that it's particularly big comparatively speaking.

Of course, this could lead one to ask what the heck is Planet 9? But that's not really relevant because I'm assuming here that you already know about it.

Like it or not, its mass and size are huge when compared to Earth. It is so massive that it's considered a planet according to the International Astronomical Union.

But, how massive? Well, for one thing its mass is estimated to be 10 times that of Earth's; its size is about half the distance from the sun to Pluto.

And, I'm sorry to say but it's going to be a black hole.

It's huge, its mass is greater than Earths' and it's dense. So I think that it qualifies to be a black hole.



Same exact question can be resubmitted in this app. I did so here just to see how consistent the result was.


Answer --->

First you have to define what a black hole is, and the parameters of how it can be defined. You then need to figure out if these actually apply to Planet 9 or not.

A black hole is something of a paradox, and so any definition will need to account for that. Black holes are the supermassive remnants of stars which collapse in upon themselves under their own gravity, but then suddenly disappear from our universe entirely.

The nature of this paradox is explained by the event horizon. The event horizon is a border around black holes beyond which nothing can escape or survive, not even light. This makes them impossible to observe and know about directly.

In the case of Planet 9, it is a planet so massive and dense that its own gravity prevents light from escaping. This makes our ability to perceive or study it very difficult.

However, we have indirect methods of observing such massive objects. By studying the effects they have on other celestial bodies, we can infer their existence and characteristics based on our observations. The most common way to observe a black hole is to study the effect it has on nearby stars.

For Planet 9, we can observe the effects it has on its star, our Sun. We can see that there is a small but significant drift in the orbit of objects near Planet 9 which are close enough to be affected by the planet's gravitational pull.",3,0.67,/r/Futurology/comments/j9wqlc/philosopherai_makes_prediction_about_the_density/,futurology,new

For example:

Suppose you can upload different languages of the world with the highest accuracy to your brain in a few minutes, so what is the need for artificial intelligence to do translation? Or that anyone can upload all kinds of science to their brain.

Maybe we will eventually need machines that help us because of our physical weakness, such as self-driving cars. We need self-driving because we can't drive for 48 hours straight. This is physical weakness. But with a BCI device we can increase our reaction time and driving accuracy.

Finally, we do not need to create a creature like ourselves. In fact, we can make the same being (human) mentally stronger.

A Way To Possibly Survive The Heat Death/Big Bang If CCC Is True,4,j9racu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/j9racu/a_way_to_possibly_survive_the_heat_deathbig_bang/,"I don't have the ability to show this using physics equations so please forgive me if I misphrase things. I was thinking about this amazing theory Penrose had, and it got me to wondering if for example a civilization that had become say a type 4 civilization might not be able to fully master Black Holes. As in feed one matter or energy in order to maintain it at exactly it's desired power output, or drain off energy in order to lower its mass if needed. I realized that a planet like the one in Interstellar might be a fantastic option when it comes to the heat death. In that if the Black Hole were extremely far away from all other matter in that Universe. Then it might be possible for the Universe to forget about Space/Time on a ""local"" level without suffering a global collapse. 

I imagine you could tune your orbit so that when the Big Bang happens in another part of the existing Universe you could control the flow of energy so that it misses whatever sort of civilization you have. This all assumes that a civilization that far in the future would have better mastery over the sciences and engineering etc. I've long thought that getting life threw the heat death / Big Bang was a good goal for life in the Universe. It might unify us in a way that would be otherwise impossible. I thought it was practically impossible unless you could time travel. I forgot that we had in essence ready made time machines. This is my first albeit clumsy attempt at proposing one solution that probably won't work. Consider this a jump off point. How do we as a species survive the heat death. Once we tackle the climate crisis.

Now you may say how does this concern you as an individual. I would point out that we are learning far more about aging then I ever imagined to be possible. The chance that you may become for all practical purposes immortal is no longer 0. Especially when you consider breakthroughs in nanotechnology, brain imaging, and our growing understanding of consciousness. Just recently they discovered what can be described as a frequency of consciousness. In that when the frequency was present the person was awake, and when it was not they were immediately unconscious. This says to me that we are making progress to understand what is needed for mind uploading, or maintaining life long term. 

So please think about this from that potentially long perspective. For all we know those who would be immortal are already living with us.",4,0.65,/r/Futurology/comments/j9racu/a_way_to_possibly_survive_the_heat_deathbig_bang/,futurology,new

In ""The Terminator"" the premise was the only thing that could  make it through the reverse time travel portal was living organic tissue, which preposterously somehow covered up all the metal underneath.  
  
The human ape meatsack is very fragile. Since the travel in time must also involve the travel through space, any physical time travel, accelerated or reversed, is impossible. However, the signals of whatever existed will still be there, and if a probe goes to where things were, it may be able to simulate what was there. The probe will have to transport through macro-quantum entanglement, to be where things were, instantaneously with instantaneous transport. There are results indicating a mass inside a laminar flow plasma container does not experience inertia.  
  
As for reverse time travel, we experience that whenever we look up at the stars at night. We see them where they were, relative to their distance. The information about the star is thousands of years old, in our present. What will happen is what has been speculated before, the hypothetical aliens 70 light-years away, that are now receiving the TV signals from 1950, so they are now seeing ""The Jack Benny Show"". It was broadcast from omnidirectional antenna towers and strong enough to go through the ionosphere. Those signals are in our past, but to the hypothetical star system, they are getting the signals in their present.",0,0.33,/r/Futurology/comments/j9jy02/time_travel_into_the_future_with_the_human_ape/,futurology,new

Humanocracy: a new approach to the management of low skilled jobs,24,j92mgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/j92mgj/humanocracy_a_new_approach_to_the_management_of/,"A set of interesting ideas about dismantling trashy jobs in [Humanocracy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Humanocracy-Creating-Organizations-Amazing-People/dp/1633696022/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=67132865937&dchild=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIk_HJuZqs7AIV8IBQBh1TlgTlEAAYASAAEgKsofD_BwE&hvadid=343574458747&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9045578&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=16818260026322854969&hvtargid=kwd-544992287976&hydadcr=24397_1748849&keywords=humanocracy&qid=1602407863&sr=8-1&tag=googhydr-21), by the omnipresent Gary Hamel and Michele Zanini. 	


Management in the 1990s was focused on business process re-engineering: reducing activities to individual processes, streamlining and standardising those so that they could be automated, outsourced or in other ways modularised. The outcome was lower costs, utterly standardised products and supply chain integration across national boundaries. A secondary outcome was that jobs were rendered tedious and routine, or simply destroyed. Firms discounted anything that was not tangible and immediate, and so very literally threw away their brains in redundancy. They often re-hired these same brains in consultancy, where the job was generally done badly and superficially s insight went out of date and ideas grew stale. 


Hamel and Zanini recommend a reversal of this process. ""It wedges people into narrow roles, stymies personal growth and treats human beings as mere resources."" Businesses should split into small teams, with members thinking like business people. This allows individuals to apply their local knowledge and ingenuity. These teams should be motivated by local balance sheets, being able to negotiate prices and costs with other units. The book, as your would expect from Hamel, is full of examples: Haier, Nucor, Svenska Handelsbanken. Buurtzorg is a Dutch health providers, which has divided itself into more than a thousand teams, which engage in self management, being responsible for marketing ad recruitment as well as service delivery. The whole thing is overseen by a central staff of just a hundred people. 


My concern is how this can be synchronised if the guiding principle are lost: the ""V"" word, vision. It relies on excellent leadership and the communication of non-verbal notions of ""who we are and what we want to become"", couched in terms that are meaningful to all employees. We are not very good at delivering this, and do not train our senior statff to think and speak in this way.",24,0.73,/r/Futurology/comments/j92mgj/humanocracy_a_new_approach_to_the_management_of/,futurology,new

Let's talk Social Media,7,j8v9wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/j8v9wv/lets_talk_social_media/,"I think at this current moment, with the US in the state it is currently in, few people are going to share my views about social media. Though hear me out, even if you don't agree. 

I think social media is not a bad thing. I don't think that it is a loudspeaker that allows bad information to spread. Rather, I think it is a flashlight that shows us just how much bad information, or how much ignorance, exists. 

Similar to how increasing testing can increase the number of C-19 cases we find, I think social media can expose just how much bad information we all believe to be true. But I think it is primarily showing us what already exists, rather than generating more. 

I don't think it's that ""the sheep are being misled"". I think that collectively, we are far more ignorant than we think we are. And social media shows us to this in a very uncomfortable transparent way.

Then, in my view, social media is not making us dumber, it's actually making us more aware of how dumb we have always been. 

And that makes sense to me. The internet just arrived. Before this, you would develop a few views, just enough to sustain your life, and that was it. Today, you are able to develop such deep and complex views on things, that we can now differentiate between good and bad views on an individual level. I think that's a new thing

To me, this is an important step towards ""The Singularity"". First, we have to find ourselves. Social media is a part of that process. And then once we find ourselves, we have to accept what it is we find. I think we're currently going through that process.

And once we accept ourselves, I think we'll see social media very differently. But for now, I think our anger directed towards social media is more the denial phase of grief than anything else. 

Currently, I see growing popularity in the view that social media is at the heart of all our problems. And I think that view has a lot to do with the political divisions in the US. Divisions which I've seen building since long before social media was a thing.

The growing trend of blaming social media concerns me, as it is too close to anti-progress and anti-technology related views.

Of course, I recognize how fringe this view is. Thus I expect this post will end up in the downvoted heaps. But the growing trend of blaming social media was bugging me. I wanted to write out why I felt that way. And here it is.",7,0.77,/r/Futurology/comments/j8v9wv/lets_talk_social_media/,futurology,new

2020 is almost over: So how has life changed in the last 20 years and how do you think it will change in the next 20 years?,9,j6gq2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/j6gq2p/2020_is_almost_over_so_how_has_life_changed_in/,"Some of you may not have even been alive 20 years ago so here are a few major changes that happened in the last 20 years:

 You're now on the internet more than you aren't on the internet, instead of just using it for school or work.

 Today, you can talk on the phone and use the internet at the same time.

 You no longer have to worry about breathing in secondhand smoke when going out to eat.

 You now get more excited about television than you do about movies.

 You no longer have to sit around hoping your Napster song download goes through.

 You rent movies off Amazon Prime instead of heading to Blockbuster.

 Eating at a restaurant has become a social experience.

 You can no longer go on vacation and truly take a break from everything.

 Many people see terrorist attacks a more of a looming threat today.

 You probably also have a much bigger fear of mass shootings today than you did 20 years ago.

 You now get updates from the president of the United States on Twitter.

 You no longer have to memorize anyone's phone numbers.

 You text instead of leaving voicemails.

 Everyone has a smartphone, and most people don't even know what a Nokia is.

 You have to take your shoes off when you fly now.

 Online dating is the norm today.

 You have the option to watch television without commercials.

 You now take photos on your cell phone instead of a film camera.

 You use Google Chrome instead of Internet Explorer.

 You make playlists instead of burning CDs.

 The global population has exploded.

 And more and more people are living in cities.

 Buildings are reaching previously unimaginable heights.

 The internet has changed the way we do … everything.

 Social media has taken over.

 People no longer believe in banks.

 Climate change is becoming a grim reality.

I understand that we would have to take precautions against people rigging the system as in perhaps a Bluetooth device hooked up to the cars computer. However the prizes are just motivational and not where the big payout for people would be.

Top Futurology News - For the month of September 2020,4,j4s78m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/j4s78m/top_futurology_news_for_the_month_of_september/,"As society continues to descend further into a more internet focused world as COVID continues (albeit some early openings and re-locking down in other areas), the new normal is leveraging these tech tools on a daily basis. As this trend continues, further advancements across the board abound through further investment in these sectors. Sadly, these stories get lost behind the ""news that sells"". From energy advancements to AI memristor hardware to a successful interstellar solar sail test, September was a great month!

Here are the top stories from the past month (in mostly chronological order):

# 1. [NuScale’s small nuclear reactor is first to get US safety approval](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/first-modular-nuclear-reactor-design-certified-in-the-us/)

*Ars Technica*

One hope buoying nuclear energy advocates has been the promise of “small modular reactor” designs. By dividing a nuclear facility into an array of smaller reactors, they can largely be manufactured in a factory and then dropped into place, saving us from having to build a complex, possibly one-of-a-kind behemoth on site. That could be a big deal for nuclear’s persistent financial problems, while also enabling some design features that further improve safety.

# 2.  [Microsoft launches a deepfake detector tool ahead of US election](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/microsoft-launches-a-deepfake-detector-tool-ahead-of-us-election/)

*TechCrunch*

Microsoft  has added to the slowly growing pile of technologies aimed at spotting synthetic media (aka deepfakes) with the launch of a tool for analyzing videos and still photos to generate a manipulation score. The tool, called Video Authenticator, provides what Microsoft calls “a percentage chance, or confidence score” that the media has been artificially manipulated.

# 3. [Brain-Inspired Electronic System Could Make Artificial Intelligence 1,000 Times More Energy Efficient](https://scitechdaily.com/brain-inspired-electronic-system-could-make-artificial-intelligence-1000-times-more-energy-efficient/)

*SciTech Daily*

Extremely energy-efficient artificial intelligence is now closer to reality after a study by UCL researchers found a way to improve the accuracy of a brain-inspired computing system. The system, which uses memristors to create artificial neural networks, is at least 1,000 times more energy efficient than conventional transistor-based AI hardware, but has until now been more prone to error.

# 4.  [NASA Study Proposes Airships, Cloud Cities for Venus Exploration](https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/nasa-study-proposes-airships-cloud-cities-for-venus-exploration)

*IEEE Spectrum*

It's been 35 years since a pair of robotic balloons explored the clouds of Venus. The Soviet Vega 2 and Vega 2 probes didn't manage to find any Venusians, but that may have been because we didn't know exactly what to look for. On 14 September 2020, a study published in Nature suggested that traces of phosphine in Venus' atmosphere could be an indication of a biological process: that is, of microbial alien life. If confirmed, such a finding could completely change the way we think about the universe, which has us taking a serious look at what it would take to get human explorers to Venus in the near future.

# 5.  [Stores in Japan Are Stocking Shelves With Remote-controlled Robots](https://futurism.com/the-byte/stores-japan-stocking-shelves-remote-controlled-robots)

*Futurism*

Two major convenience store franchises in Japan are testing out robots capable of stocking shelves using two creepy hands with three “fingers” each, CNN reports. The seven-foot is called Model-T, named after the Ford automobile that triggered a car revolution in the early 1900s, and was developed by Japanese startup Telexistence. During a pilot program, it was controlled by a “pilot” in an office miles away.

# 6. [IBM Unveils Quantum Roadmap, Plans 1,000-Qubit Chip by 2023](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/315020-ibm-unveils-quantum-roadmap-plans-1000-qubit-chip-by-2023)

*ExtremeTech*

IBM is one of the companies jockeying for position in the nascent field of quantum computing and the company thinks it has a roadmap to develop a universal quantum computer with up to 1,000 qubits. Such a chip would be capable of more complex workloads than any existing chip. Furthermore, IBM claims that even this 1,000-qubit CPU, codenamed Quantum Condor, is just the beginning, with long-term plans for a “million-plus” qubit chip at some unspecified point in the future.

# 7. [VIDEO: The Future of Fission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baQelfQAH54)

*Isaac Arthur | YouTube*

Nuclear Fission was once hailed as the solution to our power & energy needs, but has grown unpopular of fears of radiation, meltdowns, and radioactive waste. However, advances in science and reactor design may make atomic energy safer and more attractive in the future.

# 8. [Researchers have developed the world’s smallest ultrasound detector - It is smaller than the size of a blood cell](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/en/aktuelles/latest-news/press-information-news/article/48828/index.html)

*Helmholtz Zentrum München*

Researchers at Helmholtz Zentrum München and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have developed the world’s smallest ultrasound detector. It is based on miniaturized photonic circuits on top of a silicon chip. With a size 100 times smaller than an average human hair, the new detector can visualize features that are much smaller than previously possible, leading to what is known as super-resolution imaging.

# 9.  [One Step Closer to Interstellar Travel. A Successful Microgravity Test of a Graphene Light Sail](https://www.universetoday.com/146041/one-step-closer-to-interstellar-travel-a-successful-microgravity-test-of-a-graphene-light-sail/)

*Universe Today*

The challenge of any space journey comes down to delta-v. That is, how much you can change your speed relative to the speed of Earth. To gain delta-v, you need to have some kind of thrust. Rockets are a great way to get delta-v, but they have one big downside. Rocket fuel needs to be carried with you, and that means the faster you want to go the more fuel you need to carry. In other words, the greater the delta-v, the greater your mass to payload ratio.

# 10. [NATO's at risk if you go your own Huawei on 5G, US government warns Germany](https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/29/huawei_us_germany_pressure/)

*The Register*

The US government is continuing its crusade against Huawei, with economic undersecretary Keith Krach visiting Berlin to pressure the German government to reconsider banning the company’s kit from its 5G network. Krach reportedly told Angela Merkel and her advisers that including Huawei equipment in its next-generation networks could even put the future of NATO at risk, repeating the US government’s position that Huawei represents a national security threat. He recommended Nokia and Ericsson kit instead.

# 11.  [JAPAN OUTLINES PLAN TO POWER SPACECRAFT WITH MOON ICE](https://futurism.com/the-byte/japan-plan-power-spacecraft-moon-water)

*Futurism*

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has revealed plans to extract hydrogen from the Moon’s ice deposits to use as a fuel source, the major Tokyo-based newspaper Japan Times reports. The goal is to cut costs during the nation’s planned lunar explorations in the mid-2030s by creating a fuel source locally rather than lugging copious amounts of fuel all the way from Earth.",4,0.83,/r/Futurology/comments/j4s78m/top_futurology_news_for_the_month_of_september/,futurology,new
