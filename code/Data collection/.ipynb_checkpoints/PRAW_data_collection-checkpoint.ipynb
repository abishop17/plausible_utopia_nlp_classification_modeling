       "  'In a recent [Electrek](https://electrek.co/2017/03/27/tesla-tsla-valuable-ford/) post, the news is delivered with understatement: Tesla now has a larger market capitalization than Ford Motor Company.\\n\\nHowever, the article makes certain points that are worth thinking about before the enthusiasm gets out of hand: Namely that market cap is a measure of stock value rather than necessarily the fundamentals of a company, although those too are continuously increasing for Tesla as it builds out its Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, solar panel factory in New York, and various other facilities.\\n\\nFord remains overwhelmingly dominant compared to Tesla in its pace of manufacturing and delivery, and yet the news is a milestone in a trend that has been unfolding for years.  Tesla has been continuously advancing its ability to produce, and despite occasional dips in stock price, the stock has kept well ahead of the shockwave.\\n\\nA company that was not supposed to exist according to...well...*everyone*...now has a market capitalization of $45 billion, after a decade and a half of growth and hard-fought survival at times.  But here\\'s where the future interest comes into light: Tesla is no longer \"merely\" a car company.\\n\\nTesla is growing both up and down its own supply chain - expanding across its own entire industrial sector - entering the energy production, energy storage, and energy management industries that will increase the value of its cars.  It is also *creating* an entire industrial science of the factory-as-product, rooted in designing whole factories as if they were single products limited only by the basic laws of physics.\\n\\nA lot of OEM companies extend tendrils into their own supply chains, but these are usually just hedges - they maintain a basic capacity to serve their own needs if a major supplier has a serious interruption.  And, of course, as leverage in negotiations with their suppliers if someone is trying to strong-arm them.  That is not what Tesla is doing.\\n\\nTesla is out for conquest.  Having watched this company evolve since a decade ago, and watched its vision evolve, I can say that it intends - over the longest term - to become the world\\'s dominant producer of clean energy infrastructure, related systems, and the building and transport technologies that utilize it.\\n\\nDisaster is entirely possible when ambitions are so grand, and Tesla has averted it so often that one has to wonder if Musk\\'s genius is not mixed in with some strain of adrenaline-driven recklessness, but sooner or later you have to admit that the best guide to what someone will achieve in the future is what they have already achieved in the past.\\n\\nTesla has the tools, the talent, and the ambition to own the world.  I think they will.  They will change the energy and transport systems of the world, and possibly the basic way in which we manufacture on a large scale.  Over decades, I think they will surpass all other automakers, and then surpass them all *combined*, beginning to then challenge companies like Apple and Google - who have themselves shown awareness of the danger by experimenting with entering the auto market.  The world\\'s first trillion-dollar company may be among us.\\n\\nBut knock on wood.  Knock on it soundly.',\n",

       "  \"It seems that humanities' current purpose is largely to make money, pay taxes, and die. If you're able to escape to a different purpose it still revolves around your capacity to earn money, which usually is driven by a consumer based economy, pay taxes, and die.\\n\\nIf you're an artist, you are typically only making money if your art can make money for someone. For video games, if there isn't a profit involved then it doesn't get made. People sacrifice quality and passion to drive profits. But what are these profits after all? Essentially they're the individual's ability to amass more wealth and that wealth is used to amass more consumer goods. \\n\\nWhat if, instead, a higher emphasis were placed on advancing science and technology for the betterment of all of the planet? If everyone looked away from consumer goods and could contribute to a higher purpose, then even mind numbing jobs would have more meaning than simply acquiring wealth for consumerism and survival. Instead, now you're working to improve the advancement of all of humanity, because your tax contributions (for example) are focused on giving all of humanity greater advancements in science and medicine and tech which would, in turn, make life easier and enriched for everyone. \\n\\nThe excess wealth would not be amassed by individuals which is sat on and squandered, but it would expand and enrich these pursuits which have the primary purpose of automating processes and providing solutions to problems which all humans face. \\n\\nImagine if a medical program had trillions of dollars at its disposal worth of power, instead of a few hundred humans having that wealth between themselves for no reason other than that they invested it half a century ago? \\n\\nI know this is a radical attack on our current principles and economics but I think that we need to make a drastic shift because the rates of suicide and depression are very obvious indicators that humans are not content with slavery to a perpetual system of stepping on each other for the sake of profits and increasing individual bank accounts. \\n\\nCant we, instead of *fighting* and hoarding for a better future, work towards sincerely creating as close to a utopia as possible without individual wealth and power being a concern? What if there is simply a solution through future tech that every human can experience happiness and have all of the necessities they require for a healthy and fulfilling life? What if it doesn't involve owning mansions and drowning in excess? What if that could be experienced through future virtual reality for personal pleasure instead of actual reality at the expense of so many billions of humans lives?\\n\\nI think we have come to a point where this is actually possible. Maybe not in the next ten years. But I think it is something that can be worked towards. It would involve cooperation and genuine interest in providing our societies most brilliant minds with the propensity they need to achieve the greatest groundbreaking achievements possible in the shortest amount of time. \\n\\nCurrently many limitations in science, medicine, and technology are set by financial limits. Why should this be the case? I think that our planet has enough resources and enough hard working and intelligent people that we could achieve a far greater version of life than the average person currently experiences. Imagine instead of having to choose between buying a new fancy car and a new fancy house if you were already content and happy with what you have and you were able to choose how you spend your free time with your friends and family? I think time is more valuable than the pursuit of consumer goods. We could provide much needed time and peace of mind to more people if our science and tech allowed us to. \\n\\nWhy do we not have bright minds focused towards these pursuits by giving them the tools they need to do so? We put so much emphasis on working long hours to amass wealth to make the next expensive clothing or the next fast car or the next big television, but these things are empty temporary pleasures that have very little happiness value compared to a harmonious society where people rely on advanced possibilities, technologies/scientific & medical breakthroughs of the future which are no longer a dream because we have all contributed to making them real here and now instead of simply wishing. \\n\\nIt would be possible for everyone to have everything they could dream of in an advanced virtual reality for example. Why do we need physical goods and waste and byproducts of waste as things and stuff just grow obsolete or damaged and constantly replaced by the next shiny things and stuff? \\n\\nThis is a little bit of a rambling but it's an idea I had and thought I'd share it. Maybe I'm not able to make sense of this idea any better. Perhaps some of you can throw your ideas out there as well. Even if we are just dreaming, I think dreams are important and eventually become reality when people see incentive in them. A lot of talk of socialism seems to still revolve around profits and an archaic sense of monetary wealth. I just feel that our current technology has shown that this system is becoming obsolete and we should shift towards something better. I know rich people wont like this as much as poor people because they have a hand up on everyone, but what if that hand up is unnecessary and what if your happiness could increase along with everyone else's by owning and being part of an advanced civilization instead of sitting in the 21st century still arguing over 17th century ideologies?\",\n",

       "  'I had initially written this up for r/sciences (consider subscribing if you are looking for a new science subreddit!), but I thought people here might appreciate it as well:\\n\\n___\\n\\nYesterday, the *Jerusalem Post* ran a story with the headline: [A cure for cancer. Israeli scientists say they think they found one: “we believe we will offer in a year\\'s time a complete cure for cancer.\"](https://www.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/A-cure-for-cancer-Israeli-scientists-say-they-think-they-found-one-578939?fbclid=IwAR3aNem1hoRIP1R-DxqDf36ntHAXd7VGT0a_Ki_-6zkVJRxsDUdXn65jM7A). The NY POST, FoxNews, Forbes, multiple Murdoch TV outlets and more ran similar articles. Even on reddit, the post was heavily upvoted in subreddits ranging from r/futurology to r/worldnews to r/the_donald.\\n\\nFrankly, the ability of unpublished research from a no-name company to garner this type of attention stunned me. And really made me angry. I had two relatives reach out to me asking if I had heard the good news. Injecting this kind of hype into science is good for no one. It gives patients false expectations. It gives researchers perverse incentives to sensationalize their findings. It makes the already hard business of developing effective medicines more difficult than it needs to be.\\n\\nI think, intuitively, many of us rejected the article as likely to be false. Claims of curing cancer in a year seem preposterous, to anyone with a bit of familiarity for how drug development works. And many of us have internalized the idea that \\'cancer isn\\'t one disease, it is a collection of related diseases\\' and were appropriately skeptical that one drug could cure them all.\\n\\nThat said, people have been asking for a more specific breakdown of the story. I am a bit loathe to give it more attention, but since it is already trending, it might be worth helping generate a discussion about the specifics of what is wrong with this story.\\n\\nAt its core, the basic premise of the research here is that:\\n\\n> sometimes tumors evolve resistance to drugs with single targets, so let\\'s use our platform to develop drugs with multiple targets\\n\\nOn the face of it, it sounds good. Combination therapies have worked wonders in the viral and bacterial spaces. So why not cancer?\\n\\nThe truth is, we already do use combination therapies across all sorts of cancers. Chemo + targeted therapy (say, [R-CHOP](https://www.verywellhealth.com/r-chop-2252166)) has worked wonders for some blood cancers, for example. There are a myriad of other examples. Some are amazingly effective. Some are modestly better than the previous standard of care. Some combos involve chemo. Some don\\'t.\\n\\nBut, we still haven\\'t cured cancer. It\\'s a tricky SOB.\\n\\nNow let\\'s try to dig a bit more into the specifics of the company\\'s \\'miracle cure\\' claims:\\n\\nThe research tools described in the article and on the company website give little to suggest that they will overcome the factors that have limited the success of other targeted approaches (toxicity, resistance, identifying good targets etc.). Essentially, it looks like they are using a fairly standard drug discovery phage display platform to find peptides that bind tumor cells. Their plan is then to link these peptides to a chemotoxin and thereby more specifically deliver toxic drugs to tumors.\\n\\nA few things:\\n\\n1. This basic technology already exists in the form of multiple FDA approved drugs ([Adcetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentuximab_vedotin) for certain blood cancers; [Kadcyla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab_emtansine) for breast cancer) with more under development. These are good drugs. But in neither case would anyone call them \\'cures\\'.\\n\\n2. The article highlights that the researchers use \\'Nobel prize winning\\' [phage display technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_display) as if to connote that the research they are doing is particularly impactful. This is nonsense. The technology won the Nobel because it is so broadly used. Sometimes it yields amazing results. Sometimes it yields crap. The fact that the researchers are using phage display to generate peptides is close to meaningless.\\n\\n3. The real challenge in this approach of using peptides/proteins to more specifically deliver toxins to tumor cells is finding targets that are adequately specific to the tumors of interest. The researchers gave no indication that they have made a breakthrough on this front. And I cannot imagine what a target that broadly marked all tumor types and no essential normal tissue would look like. That is a holy grail type target in the field.\\n\\nA few things too about how the results are described that drove me crazy:\\n\\n1. The article states they have \"concluded its first exploratory mice experiment, which inhibited human cancer cell growth and had no effect at all on healthy mice cells\". THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE! Mice are not humans. Human-target-specific peptide will recognize human epitopes on the tumor xenograft cells, but possibly not the mouse epitopes. That\\'s why lots of drugs look awesome in mouse models - highly specific binders to implanted human cells with low mouse off-targets of course minimizes target-related toxicity.\\n\\n2. The article quotes: “Our results are consistent and repeatable.” Umm.. what? YOU JUST SAID THEY FINISHED THE FIRST EXPERIMENT!\\n\\n3. The articles did a terrible job getting outside opinions to reality check these extraordinary claims. To me that is shoddy journalism.\\n\\nSorry for the rant - but this one really bothered me! Happy to take any more questions about this story/drug development!',\n",

       "  'Will this be forgotten or will we start making change? In many jobs and colleges worldwide remote-anything is looked down upon, often out of pure preprogrammed traditions. I am definitely looking forward to things being more flexible. But I really hope we look back and remember 2020 as the year that changed how we normally work and learn. What do you think will happen?\\n\\nEdit: after reading through the comments, a lot of people mention the lost social factor when working/learning remotely. I actually agree, that’s an obvious disadvantage to working remotely 100% of the time. And as many mentioned a system where you “just do the work/learning however you like” is probably best. You can come into work some days and work remotely other days. Having both options is important.',\n",
