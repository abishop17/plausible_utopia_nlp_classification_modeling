Like all celestial bodies, it has its own gravitational pull which causes things to fall towards it and hence creates density. Therefore, if you were to put an object on this planet's surface then it would become more dense depending upon how close or far away from the center of gravity they are.\\n\\nThe center of gra...   \n",

For example:\\n\\nSuppose you can upload different languages of the world with the highest accuracy to your brain in a few minutes, so what is the need for artificial intelligence to do translation? Or that anyone can upload all kinds of science to their brain.\\n\\nMaybe we will eventually need machines that help us because of our physical weakness, such as self-driving cars. We need self-driving because we can't drive for 48 hours straight. This is physical weakness. But with a BCI device we can increase our reaction time and driving accuracy.\\n\\nFinally, we do not need to create a creature like ourselves. In fact, we can make the same being (human) mentally stronger.\\n\\nDo you agree with my view?   \n",

       "j9racu  I don't have the ability to show this using physics equations so please forgive me if I misphrase things. I was thinking about this amazing theory Penrose had, and it got me to wondering if for example a civilization that had become say a type 4 civilization might not be able to fully master Black Holes. As in feed one matter or energy in order to maintain it at exactly it's desired power output, or drain off energy in order to lower its mass if needed. I realized that a planet like the one in Interstellar might be a fantastic option when it comes to the heat death. In that if the Black Hole were extremely far away from all other matter in that Universe. Then it might be possible for the Universe to forget about Space/Time on a \"local\" level without suffering a global collapse. \\n\\nI imagine you could tune your orbit so that when the Big Bang happens in another part of the existing Universe you could control the flow of energy so that it misses whatever sort of civilization you hav...   \n",

They depend on our consumption of gas in a disorganized way in order to keep pushing our species closer to extinction.

However the prizes are just motivational and not where the big payout for people would be. \\n\\nOnce we have progressed our distributed boycott to the point that those companies are susceptible to a hostile buyout then we use the money we saved from the subscribers to do a hostile takeover of the target companies.

Usually electrolysis is paired with renewable energy to mitigate concerns about the process using large amounts of energy which will come from fossil fuels. It sounds great, but I have questions about the environmental impact.\\n\\nIf we drain lakes and rivers and split up the water, would that not permanently remove the water from the hydrosphere? Is there any risk of widespread use of electrolysis causing water shortages? Would this make electrolysis impractical for areas that don’t have large amounts of water? And unrelated, does the water have to be pure, or can you get waste water and run it through the electrolysis process?\\n\\nEdit: and what if you use the hydrogen to produce steel like I’ve been seeing?   \n",
       "j33e1n  Working from home has forced us to realise that we don't need to go to the office 5 days a week to be efficient. We won't/can't go backwards to crowding cities.

I'm starting to see the beginnings of it already, with my mate's firm having just signed a deal to rent out their skyscraper to an organisation who will repurpose it into a combination of housing, service and office. The firm's staff are finding temporary/shared office space they can rent by the day that's much cheaper than their previous commute and gets them out of their houses and generally walking/cycling distance to their homes.\\n\\nThis isn't just about Covid-19 anymore, though that was the catalyst.
