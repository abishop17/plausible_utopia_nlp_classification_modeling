    "\n",
    "**Question:** Do futurist and scientist interest groups use vocabulary in a distinguishable way? Does an analysis of the words in their vocabulary and the frequency of use enable us to classify them using only text from subreddit titles?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data source:** I will use datasets collected via the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) API from the [`futurology`](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology) and [`science`](https://www.reddit.com/r/Science) subreddits on the social news platform [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project goal and evaluation:** I will use binary classification models (logistic regression and Random Forest) to predict which of these two subreddits a given post comes from. I will evaluate the models' performance with their accuracy scores."

    "### Data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) in the data collection process. You can find the steps I took in the `PRAW_data_collection` notebook, located in the code folder of this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The East Coast local instructors were very generous with their starter code / walkthrough of the process, so I definitely credit them for the ease of the data collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the [API documentation](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/praw_models.html), I selected additional columns beyond the starter code, in order to do more EDA. See data dictionary below.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made three sets of API pulls (one for each subreddit), one per selected submission type of `new`, `controversial` and `new`. I made sure to obtain fairly balanced classes in each pull.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the dataframe before vectorizing the text was 3,137 rows and 2 columns (the `title` and `subreddit` columns). After vectorizing the text with CountVectorizer, the size of the dataframe was 2 rows (consisting of the binary classes) and 50,491 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: The data source\n",
    "\n",
    "[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) is a social news platform founded in 2005 and calls itself the \"front page of the internet\". \n",
    "\n",
    ">Reddit is broken up into more than a million communities known as “subreddits,” each of which covers a different topic. The name of a subreddit begins with /r/, which is part of the URL that Reddit uses.\n",
